# MinHash
This Python code performs some operations on DNA sequences data represented as a list of sequences. Specifically, it calculates a probability distribution for each sequence, based on the number of times it hashes to each of a set of fixed hash values, and then compares the probability distribution of a randomly chosen set of sequences to that of an algorithmically chosen set of sequences.
